Since there were many data groups in London I felt there should be one for India.\u201d Anand S one of the founders. The first few members were Thej, Naveen, Bala and Manu, theywere all working with data in some capacity either professional or personal. Naveen had just started Gramener a data analytics firm,Bala and Manu had started Report Bee, on data analysis for education, Thej was working at Janaagraha and Infosys on data projects. They all shared a passion for sharing and open data, and other open source technologies. They called it DataMeet because \u201cit was available\u201d then invited people they knew to join the list and had Skype calls about sharing data science tips. You can see the minutes from the first meeting here. Eventually the group started to attract non tech people who have to deal with data issues in India and a small meetup in Bangalore was started. The Bangalore group decided to do an Open Data Camp to explore the larger issues and meet more people who care about the status of data in India. Today the group has grown to encompass many people, ideas, projects, solutions, and challenges that using data in India presents. With 1500 people and growing on the Google group, 5 active city chapters, trainings and events to promote and use open data, DataMeet is continuously looking for ways to bring open data to the forefront. ====== Who is Data{Meet}? ====== DataMeet is made up of volunteers from around the country. [[ http://datameet.org/about/|About DataMeet]] The lead organizer is Nisha Thompson. The Chairman is Thejesh GN and Anand S is a Trustee. The chapters are run by volunteers who wanted to build a strong network in their areas. You can meet the organizers on the chapter pages. See chapter pages for more information. ====== What do we do? ====== * DataMeet creates spaces for people to discuss and share data. The Google group is a primary place to ask questions and share information, projects, and solutions. [[ https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/datameet|Group Discussion]] * The meetups are to share projects and meet others. * The chapters are places for local networks and relationships to form that are beyond just data questions. * We do hackathons to free data that people want. * We have trainings to teach data skills to journalists and others.[[workshops:data-journalism-workshop-hoot-dm-cm|Data Journalism workshop with The Hoot and Oorvani Foundation]] * We have consultations with non profits and the government on data issues, strategy, and best practices.[[ http://datameet.org/2016/01/11/investing-in-data-pre-budget-consultation-with-the-finance-minister/|Consultations ]] * We have Open DataCamps to have deep dives and bring diverse people together about a topic.

Group discussion (10 am - 10.30 am) : ===== Bringing data for the masses by giving context to data and writing stories that people can relate to. Taking insights from data - through analysis starting with a story Meaningful infographics visually gripping data ===== Global and Indian Context for Data Journalism: Jayadevan's session (10.30 am to 11.30 am) ===== New digital era Print media is on a decline, off late. New media organizations emerging, mostly digital and online media. Internalization of media Global media houses like Bloomberg, New York Times, Business Insider pushing country specific pages. Share economy, ready to share data sets and interchange and exchange data. Example: Indian election was covered by World Media India has favorable demography for digital journalism. Data is important part of any news. Generalization of media houses is dead. Everyone is doing everything. Shorter news cycle. Unlike Print media days Social Media remains the prime distribution Platform. Digital journalism has shorter turn around time. Things go viral or die out. Aggregating data is imp for effective story. Need to leverage power of dynamic data presentation when reporting on the web. Unlike just scanning the print stuff to the web. Dynamic graphs and interactive maps are way to go for effective presentation on the web. ===== Good and Bad Data Journalism: Thej's session (11.30 am - 12.15 pm) ===== [[See examples here]] https://docs.google.com/a/datameet.org/presentation/d/114fC0rleoBqqJO3z7x36fjjlYmr_PK13vWEN4bgUnXM/edit?usp=sharing Example of good data story, What makes a good data story? Story, InfoGraphs or Conclusions? Nightingale's visualization on number of deaths of soldiers due to poor conditions- Eye opening conclusions. A trend emerging from a story narrated with data in a map. Propublica's \"Hidden story behind redistricting of constituencies have a corporate hand behind them\"- Explaining cause and effect with data, Power of an interactive map compared over a time. Climate change visuals - Less data very very few words but really beautiful visuals also does equally great job. The Hindu story about ongoing sexual assault cases and their resolution in New Delhi. - Power of reporting data and explaining it in the followup stories. Mapping access to toilets according to the social groups. Using maps to tell powerful stories Gun control in America by state. - Creative presentations and comparisons. Putting lot of information effectively. Great story needs great data and even greater presentation. Bad examples of data stories: The Globe and The Daily Mail,gun laws in the state, Fox job loss, Gallup LGBT Percentage, Health assessment Choosing right scales, colors and graphs important for effective presentation of data. Tools for data analysis and data visualization. Map, time and place is a important context building medium in data presentation. Choice of color contrast, scale and percentage representation is most important. Think through before visualizing. ===== Sources of Data: Nisha's Session (12.15 pm to 12.45 pm): ===== Introduction to- [[data.gov.in]] http://data.gov.in/ Data bill not as powerful as RTI, And why? Demand driven data sets on the website, Neat visualizations, updated data. Easy to download in import friendly format. Other sources of government data: tenders.gov.in, gazette.kar.ac.in, data.gov.in Newsletter from the Ministry of Health is released weekly. Pretty good, demographically spread. Datameet data catalogue, OpenCorporates, WorldBank is a great resource. Data laws in India is a grey area. Data cannot be copyrighted and but the process can be. Lookout for the copyright associated and licenses when picking up data for a story. Government data is best to start with, Do report the source department. But careful with certain organizations/department like ISRO Technically, drawing maps in India is not allowed. Only Survey of India can do. Always verify the authenticity of data before reporting. Hence Gov data is generally preferred. Report the source, credits, references, place and dates. Seek permission if the data is outside creative commons or belongs to a private firm. IndianKanoon.org -- collection of recent the court cases (Post 1985) and ability to search. 12:45 to 1:15 LUNCH ===== Tableau Demo: Nisha's session: (1.15pm-1.45pm) ===== Introduction to Tableau Public, Data visualization tool. Import your dataset and drag-drop to the dashboard. Formula free and a great first level analysis tool. Used by Business community for research, Social sector, Journalists and freelancers. Similar to Infogram but more functional and powerful. Gets public when you save it. ===== CartoDB Demo: Thej's Session (1.45pm- 2:45pm) ===== Creating beautiful maps with your data. Example of BMTC bus stop density visualizing with CartoDB with maps. Introduction to Visuals, Data view and Map view. Introduction 'Table to clipboard' firefox/ chrome plugin for moving data from a web table(s) to excel sheet in a clean way. Introduction to 'iMacros' firefox/chrome plugin to record a macro and perform a repetitive operation. Twitter hashtag interactive maps using CartoDB Introduction to ScraperWiki - extract data from web pages and pdf. Introduction to Mapbox by TileMill beta for creating interacting maps. Plans about Free PDF event Used by cartographers for creating interactive maps. Intro to QGIS tool Chai break (2.45pm-3:00pm) ===== Visualization Roadmap: Nisha's Session (3:00pm- 4:00pm) ===== Think of a story. Gather the stats. Mine dataset related to it. Narrow down the Audience : web/print. Language of the article. Thinking of Personas while drafting. Creating visuals for it, Keep it simple. Pick relevant scales : Country/Regional. Validation of the finding and the overall article. Case studies discussed in class: Petroleum import from Iran. Water and Garbage data for new buildings in Whitefield and Mahadevapura Tree Planting data in Bangalore ===== Sharing tools from the Visualization Roadmap Session: Thej's Session (4:00pm- 4.30pm) ===== Introduction to Bhuvan, India's Remote sensing Portal Analysing increase in area for Bangalore Map from 2004 to 2014. Concept for Map overlay Introduction to Timeline - Beautifully crafted timeline Making a TimeLine' two types one with Time and events other with Time, places and events. Introduction to StoryMap - Map that tell stories. Public api's from data.gov.in Odyssey, Nice data visualization tool. Introduction to Fusion Tables - Google's version of Tableau Case study of Bangalore Urban Metropolitan Project (BUMP). Resource and data rich portal for research and digging stories. ===== Feedback and Survey: 4.30 pm -4:45 pm ===== Split it in two days Hands on with tools.

Since 2012 we have held meetings in Bangalore, New Delhi and Hyderabad and have an annual Open Data Camp (ODC) with more than 150 participants from the education, business, technology and non-profit sectors in India. In the third annual Open Data Camp on 22-23 March 2014, we explored election data and how citizens can use it to understand the electoral process and create tools that help people gain access to essential voting information. We had former Chief Election Commissioner Shri T.N. Krishnamurthy deliver the keynote address and discuss his time with the Election Commission. We would like to firstly applaud the Election Commission for putting information on their site in a proactive manner. The amount of information at the Centre and State level is astounding and people have been using it to get information from where to vote, who is running, and various other candidate information. However, during this event we made a list of data that if the Election Commission released in a more open format would provide more transparency and access so that more people can use it. For example MyNeta.info is a website trying to expand the use of this data. We respectively request the following be considered: Post 2009, Parliamentary and Assembly Constituency boundaries in GIS, ESRI SHAPEFILE, JSON and XML files [*], candidate affidavits in non pdf format, preferably in CSV or XML party expense reports in non pdf formats list of assembly constituencies in each parliamentary constituency in one aggregated form list of polling centers in an assembly constituency in one aggregated form list of polling stations in each polling center in one aggregated form name of ward/mandal/taluk for each polling center in one aggregated form unique IDs for candidates For further reference on formats please refer to the NDSAP implementation policy section 3.2 ( http://data.gov.in/sites/default/files/NDSAP_Implementation_Guidelines_2.2.pdf ) Sirs, we understand you are very busy at this important time. We salute your work, and sincerely appreciate your website which is a valuable public resource for understanding Indian elections. We sincerely request the Commissioners to consider the change in formats for the next election. We have attached a summary of the event and recommendations for standards for the data.

This policy is the first step toward opening up government data, however, now that it has been implemented through the creation data.gov.in there are many flaws in the policy that prevent it being the cornerstone for truly opening up government data. The following are changes that the open data community would like to see so that the NDSAP so that it can truly become an open data policy and so that Data.Gov.In and other initiatives can fulfill its promise of openness and transparency. Establishing Open Data as the goal of the NDSAP The NDSAP is clearly aimed at the internal audience of government ministries, however, it\u2019s scope goes beyond internal issues and moves into the public sphere. It\u2019s overall goal should be to make government more transparent to its citizens and should become an open data policy not just an internal sharing policy. RTI Integration India\u2019s premiere transparency legislation the Right to Information already has requirements in it for proactive sharing of information, including data. There is no reason that the NDSAP should stray far from this requirements. By aligning with the RTI policy it will strengthen the bill and give it popular support. 1. Use RTI\u2019s privacy stipulations and transparently and clearly define what is classified and what isn\u2019t 2. Nothing prevents everything from being put in the Restricted Use category. Make clear what is considered priority data and what datasets will be published. Offer guidelines on what should be registered and what should be restricted. 3. Pricing policy. Not linked to RTI or any other clear pricing guidelines that establish what data has to be paid for and way. In addition data that has been 100% collected using public funds should be noted separately as data collected with some private partnership. 4. Restricted lists should be published for each department with reasons as to why this data is not open. 5. It is unclear from the policy what all departments it covers, and whether it is enforceable. This policy should cover the same scope as the Right to Information (RTI) Act: all 'public authorities' as defined under the RTI Act should be covered by this policy. Transparency in decision making of how data is assigned to category The rationale for the three-fold categorization is unclear. In particular, it is unclear why the category of 'registered access' exists, and on what basis the categorization into 'open access' and 'registered access' is to be done. If the purpose of registration is to track usage, there are many better ways of doing so without requiring registration. A. Having three categories of: Open data Partially restricted data Restricted data B. Data that is classified as non-shareable (as per a reading of s.8 and s.9 of RTI Act as informed by the decisions of the Central Information Commission) should be classified as \u2018restricted\u2019. C. The rationale for classifying data as 'open' or 'partially restricted' should be how the data collection body is funded. If it depends primarily on public funds, then the data it outputs should necessarily be made fully open. If it is funded primarily through private fees, then the data may be classified as 'partially restricted'. 'Partially restricted' data may be restricted for non-commercial usage, with registration and/or a licence being required for commercial usage. Standardized and open formats for data download. As seen on the current data.gov.in site there is a lack of consistent standards when it comes to how the data is available. The policy should aim to require open standards, and require that the data that is put out be compliant with the Interoperability Framework for e-Governance (IFEG) that the government is currently in the process of drafting and finalizing. A. The policy should reference the National Open Standards Policy that was finalised by the Department of Information Technology in November 2010, as well as to the IFEG. B. The data should be made available, insofar as possible, in structured documents with semantic markup, which allows for intelligent querying of the content of the document itself. Before settling upon a usage-specific semantic markup schema, well-established XML schemas should be examined for their suitability and used wherever appropriate. It must be ensured that the metadata are also in a standardized and documented format. Copyright No license has been prescribed in the policy for the data. Despite India not allowing for database rights, it still allows for copyright over original literary works, which includes original databases. All governmental works are copyrighted by default in India, just as they are in the UK. To ensure that this policy goes beyond merely providing access to data to ensure that people are able to use that data, it must provide for a conducive copyright license. A. The license that has been created by the UK government (another country in which all governmental works are copyrighted by default) may be referred to: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/ B. However, the UK needed to draft its own license because the concept of database rights are recognized in the EU, which is not an issue here in India. Thus, it would be preferable to use the Open Data Commons - Attribution license: http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/ The UK license is compatible with both the above-mentioned license as well as with the Creative Commons - Attribution license, and includes many aspects that are common with Indian law, e.g., bits on usage of governmental emblems, etc. Archival and longevity The policy is silent on how long data must be made available. There must be a system of archival that is prescribed to enable citizens to access older data. Further, a versioning and nomenclature system is required alongside the metadata to ensure that citizens know the period that the data pertains to, and have access to the latest data by default.","title":"Responsetondsap"},{"location":"start/","text":"====== DataMeet Wiki ====== Welcome to the wiki. ===== Data Link Repository ===== * [[indiangeospatialdata|Indian Geo Spatial Data]] * [[catalog | DataMeet Data Catalog]] ===== Group Business ===== * [[logocontest|DataMeet Logo Contest]] * [[organizations-using-open-data-india| Organizations Using Open Data in India ]] ===== Events ===== * [[workshops|Workshops]] * [[hackathons|Hackathons]] * [[meetups|Meetups]] * [[odc|Open Data Camps]] ===== Recommendations ===== * [[odclettertoecidraft|Draft Letter to ECI post ODC2014]] * [[responsetondsap | Feedback given to NIC and DST in response to the NDSAP policy in Jan 2013]] ===== Tools/ Books/ Tutorials ===== We are cataloging the Tools/ Books/ Tutorials that can be used by the community to build their projects on.

Don\u2019t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn\u2019t get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.","title":"Code of Conduct"},{"location":"guidelines/datameet-community-code-of-conduct/#questions","text":"If you have questions, feel free to contact us at admin@datameet.org","title":"Questions?"},{"location":"guidelines/datameet-community-code-of-conduct/#meta","text":"Version: v.1.0 Status: Published Thejesh GN 2014/12/01 05:47 Author: Thejesh GN 2014/10/25 23:52 Credits: Original text courtesy of the Django and Speak Up! project.
